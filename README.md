# Marmojs-sdk

# Description
Marmojs-sdk helps developers to consume Marmo Relayer.

# Simple Summary
Allowing users to sign messages to show intent of execution, but allowing a third party relayer to execute them is an emerging pattern being used in many projects. 
This pattern simplifies the integration with any Ethereum based platform. 
Marmo relayer: (https://github.com/ripio/marmo-relayer). 

# Abstract
### User pain points:
> - Users don't want to think about ether
> - Users want to be able to pay for transactions using whatever they have 
> - Users donâ€™t want to download apps/extensions (at least on the desktop) to connect to their apps
